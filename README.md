# F1track_design
A simulation of a proposed design for a section of the Formula One circuit in Monaco using **MATLAB**, focusing on enhancing spectator safety near sharp curves. The design employs a cubic function to create the track's curvature, allowing for precise calculations of key points along the path.

## Project features
* Cubic Function Design: Employs a cubic polynomial for smooth track curvature.
* Safety Analysis: Calculates slopes to identify optimal locations for grandstands, enhancing safety.
* MATLAB Simulation: Visualizes the track design and safety evaluations, demonstrating the relationship between curvature and safety parameters.
* Polynomial Fitting: Uses the polyfit function for curve fitting.
* Graphical Output: Generates plots of the circuit, tangents, and safety metrics.
* Safety Metrics: Evaluates frictional forces and safety based on vehicle speed and track curvature.
